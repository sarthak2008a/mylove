					<p>Love is one of life’s most powerful forces—an invisible thread that ties two souls together in
						ways that words often fail to describe. It blooms in the quietest moments and grows stronger
						with every shared smile, every comforting hug, and every whispered "I love you." Today, that
						love feels even more special, because it’s the birthday of someone who makes my world brighter
						just by being in it.
					</p>

				</div>
				<div class="wish-section">
					<img src="./WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 14.25.25_3688a0e1.jpg" alt="">
					<p> Your birthday isn’t just a celebration of the day you were born—it’s a celebration of every
						moment, every laugh, every adventure we’ve shared since you walked into my life. You are more
						than just my girlfriend; you are my best friend, my safe place, and the reason I believe in love
						so deeply. Each day with you feels like a gift, and today, I want to return that
						feeling tenfold.
					</p>


				</div>
				<div class="wish-section">
					<img src="./WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 14.25.26_7b50c308.jpg" alt="">
					<p> Love, in its truest form, is about presence, understanding, and a kind of magic that brings
						peace to the soul. That’s what you’ve given me. Your love has been a light in my darkest times
						and a joy in my happiest. You’ve shown me that love doesn’t have to be perfect—it just has to be
						real, and with you, it’s the most real thing I’ve ever known.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div class="wish-section">
					<img src="./WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 14.25.26_b50a0f8d.jpg" alt="">
					<p> As we celebrate your birthday, I’m reminded of how lucky I am to walk through life with you by
						my side. Your strength, your kindness, and your beautiful heart inspire me every single day. The
						world may see you as one person, but to me, you are the world. Loving you has been the most
						natural thing I’ve ever done—and celebrating you today is just a small way of showing that.
					</p>

				</div>


				<div class="wish-section">
					<img src="./WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 14.25.28_4ac7ee45.jpg" alt="">
					<p>You deserve all the happiness this day can bring and so much more. Birthdays come once a year,
						but the love I feel for you grows every single day. It’s in the little moments—the way you
						laugh, the way you care, the way you look at me like I matter—that I realize how lucky I am. And
						today, I want you to feel as special as you truly are.
					</p>

				</div>


				<div class="wish-section">
					<img src="./WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 14.25.27_f9538c32.jpg" alt="">
					<p>Thank you for being you—for loving me, for letting me love you, and for simply existing. I hope
						this birthday reminds you of how cherished you are, not just by me, but by everyone lucky enough
						to know you. You make everything better just by being part of it, and that’s a kind of magic
						no one else has.
					</p>

				</div>


				<div class="wish-section">
					<img src="./WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 14.25.27_c421a57b.jpg" alt="">
					<p> So here’s to you, to the beautiful soul you are, and to the love that binds us so sweetly. Happy
						birthday, my love. I hope this day fills your heart the way you fill
						mine—completely and endlessly
